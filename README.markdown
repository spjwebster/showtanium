==========

A [Titanium](http://titaniumapp.com/)-based GUI for [pytvshows](http://pytvshows.sourceforge.net/), based on [AirShows](http://github.com/spjwebster/airshows) (which itself was based on [TVShows.app](http://tvshows.sourceforge.net/)).

I'm using this as a vehicle for comparing [Titanium](http://titaniumapp.com/) to [Adobe AIR](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/) for building cross-platform desktop applications. I don't know if this will ever be feature-compatible with [AirShows](http://github.com/spjwebster/airshows).
